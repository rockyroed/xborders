  ...

### Config
Configuration options can be found by passing in the argument `--help` on the command line, or by specifying a config file with the argument `-c`. If no config file is specified with the `-c` argument, xborders will look for one at ~/.config/xborders/xborders.json. However, it will not create the file if it is missing.

The config file is just a simple json file with the keys being the same as the command-line arguments (except without the "--" at the beginning).
